# EnviroDIY_HX711

### About

This is an EnviroDIY sensor adapter for the canonical HX711 Arduino library 
[HX711] by Bogdan Necula, a software interface to the Avia Semiconductor HX711 
24-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for weight scales.

It is being conceived for the [PíPá Datalogger] of the [Hiveeyes project],
which is developing a flexible beehive monitoring infrastructure toolkit.

### Features

This library is still in its infancy and contributions are very welcome.
Within the implementation `AviaSamiHX711.cpp`, there are some gaps which need
to be fixed.
