# EnviroDIY_HX711

### About

This is a [EnviroDIY ModularSensors] adapter for the canonical [HX711] library
by Bogdan Necula, a software interface to the Avia Semiconductor HX711 24-Bit 
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for weight scales.

[EnviroDIY] is a community for do-it-yourself environmental science and 
monitoring, their engineers are conceiving the [Mayfly Data Logger] and
corresponding software based on the Arduino HAL.

This sensor adapter is being conceived for the [PíPá Datalogger] of the
[Hiveeyes] project, which is developing a flexible beehive monitoring
infrastructure toolkit.

### Features

This library is still in its infancy and contributions are very welcome.
Within the implementation `AviaSemiHX711.cpp`, there are some gaps which need
to be fixed.
